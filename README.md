# FreeBoy - GameBoy Emulator

### Introduction
After my Chip8 Emulator adventure, my interest in low level programming 
and emulators increased even more. Therefore, I set my sights a higher 
and decided to make a GameBoy Emulator. This development adventure will be 
exciting even if it scares me a bit :).
